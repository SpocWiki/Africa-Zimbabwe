> Robert Gabriel Mugabe (Shona: [muɡaɓe]; 21 February 1924 – 6 September 2019) 
> was a Zimbabwean revolutionary and politician who served as the leader of Zimbabwe 
> from 1980 until he was deposed in a coup in 2017. 
> 
> He served as the first Prime Minister of Zimbabwe from internationally recognised independence in 1980 to 1987, 
> then as the second president of Zimbabwe from 1987 to 2017. 
> 
> He was also the Leader of the Zimbabwe African National Union (ZANU) from 1975 to 1980 
> and led its successor political party, the ZANU – Patriotic Front (ZANU–PF) 
> as its First Secretary, from 1980 to 2017. 
> 
> Ideologically an African nationalist, during the 1970s and 1980s 
> he identified as a Marxist–Leninist, and from the 1990s as a socialist.
>
> Mugabe was born to a poor Shona family in Kutama, then in Southern Rhodesia. 
> Educated at Kutama College and the University of Fort Hare, he worked as a schoolteacher. 
> Angered by white minority rule of his homeland within the British Empire, 
> Mugabe embraced Marxism and joined African nationalists calling for an independent state 
> controlled by the black majority. 
> 
> After making antigovernmental comments, he was convicted of sedition 
> and imprisoned between 1964 and 1974. 
> On release, he fled to Mozambique, established his leadership of ZANU, 
> and oversaw its role in the Rhodesian Bush War, 
> fighting Ian Smith's predominantly white government. 
> 
> He reluctantly participated in peace talks in the United Kingdom 
> that resulted in the Lancaster House Agreement, putting an end to the war. 
> In the 1980 general election, Mugabe led ZANU-PF to victory, 
> becoming Prime Minister when the country, now renamed Zimbabwe, 
> gained internationally recognised independence later that year. 
> 
> Mugabe's administration expanded healthcare and education and—
> despite his professed desire for a socialist society—
> adhered largely to mainstream economic policies.
>
> Mugabe's calls for racial reconciliation failed to stem growing white emigration, 
> while relations with Joshua Nkomo's Zimbabwe African People's Union (ZAPU) also deteriorated. 
> 
> In the Gukurahundi of 1982–1987, 
> Mugabe's 5th Brigade crushed ZAPU-linked opposition in Matabeleland 
> in a campaign that killed at least 20,000 people. 
> 
> Internationally, he sent troops into the Second Congo War 
> and chaired the Non-Aligned Movement (1986–1989), the Organisation of African Unity (1997–1998), and the African Union (2015–2016). 
> 
> Pursuing decolonisation, Mugabe emphasised 
> the redistribution of land controlled by white farmers to landless blacks; 
> from 2000 he encouraged black Zimbabweans to violently seize white-owned farms. 
> 
> Food production was severely impacted, leading to famine, hyperinflation, economic decline, and foreign sanctions. 
> 
> By 2007, Zimbabwe had the highest inflation rate in the world, at 7600%. 
> Opposition to Mugabe grew, but he was re-elected in 2002, 2008, and 2013 
> through campaigns dominated by violence, electoral fraud, 
> and nationalistic appeals to his rural Shona voter base. 
> 
> In 2017, members of his party ousted him in a coup, 
> replacing him with former vice president Emmerson Mnangagwa.
>
> Having dominated Zimbabwe's politics for nearly four decades, 
> Mugabe was a controversial figure. 
> 
> He was praised as a revolutionary hero of the African liberation struggle 
> who helped free Zimbabwe from British colonialism, imperialism, and white minority rule. 
> 
> Critics accused Mugabe of being a dictator responsible for economic mismanagement 
> and widespread corruption and human rights abuses, 
> including anti-white racism, crimes against humanity, and genocide.
